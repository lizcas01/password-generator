# Password Generator
## Description
For this challenge, we created a password generator for employees who have access to sensitive data and want a stronger password for better security. This was the first assignment to require Javascript and to be honest, I struggled quite a bit. My motivation for this project was to figure out the commands which I did. I learned what commands were most appropriate for this challenge and other commands that will most likely be needed in the future. I also learned how to do better research as I needed it for the confirmation and validation section. It took me a while but I figured it out.

To use this password generator, click on the red button. The site will then proceed to show you a pop-up asking how long you want your password to be. After entering an acceptable number, you will then have to answer more prompts until a password is generated.
